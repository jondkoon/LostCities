Conservative AI

Expedition
- Choose a suit that has at least a 21 point value
- lay down the lowest card

- If you have an existing expedition that takes precedence

Discard
- If you can't pursue an expedition then discard
- Discard cards that neither you or your oponent can use first
- discard from the suit with the lowest point value
- Never 10's
- Discard 9's only if your oponent can't use them


Drawing cards
- Always draw cards for expeditions you are pursuing if you can use them
- Draw cards if they can bring your total for that suite over 12. Don't draw cards less than 4.
- Draw from deck otherwise
